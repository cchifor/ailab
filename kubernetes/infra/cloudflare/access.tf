# ttyd is a PASSWORDLESS-SUDO shell, so every dev-worker hostname MUST be gated: each gets a
# self_hosted Access application with an interactive Allow policy locked to allow_email. dns.tf
# `depends_on` these apps, so Access is enforcing BEFORE the hostname ever resolves — there is no
# window where dwN.chifor.me reaches the shell unauthenticated. (The status/api scaffolding stays
# opt-in in access.tf.example; this file activates only the dev-worker apps.)
